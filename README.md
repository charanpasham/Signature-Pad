Signature pad <br/> 

It helps to generate base64 string from a signed text. It can also convert base64 string to an image/png. 
I used <a href="https://github.com/agilgur5/react-signature-canvas">react signature canvas library </a> to develop this app.
- Clone the project.<br />
- Go inside the project directory. <br /> 
- Run <b>npm restore</b> to install the dependencies. <br /> 
- Finally run <b>npm start</b> to run the react app. 
- It should by default run on localhost:3000.
